# logo-turtle

Online logo turtle to learn programming to children by fun, starting with mines

I found only one logo online in french: http://www.tortue-logo.fr/fr/tortue-logo but did not find it easy enough for children.

App should be browser, with a keyboard mode (desktop/laptop/keyb enabled tablets), and also with a touch mode (tablet, phones).

Language itself should be internationalized, starting with french and english, other contribution to be done on github.

Learning should be very progressive and with an interactive step by step mode.

App should be full of nice samples

language in french :
```
av avance <n>
td tourne droite <n>
tg tourne gauche <n>
ve vide ecran
lc leve crayon
pc pose crayon
co couleur <couleur>
ep epaisseur <n>
re repete <n> \n ... \n fin
po pour <nom> \n ... \n fin
de dessine <nom>
md mirroir droit <nom>
mg mirroir gauche <nom>
mh mirroir haut <nom>
mb mirroir bas <nom>
re recule n
```

Example of interactive step by step learning :
```
Hello, what's your name ? (type it and then it Enter, the big touch on right side)
> John
Hello John ! Let's start learning logo !
First let's make it move ; hit "move forward" and Enter
> move forward
Great, you see how it has moved !
Lets do it again but with less words ; hit "forward" and Enter (from now on, always hit Enter once finished typing)
> forward
You saw ? The turtle understood it and moved same way, no need to write complete sentences.
You may also tell here to move longer ; hit "forward 10"
> forward 10
Great ! It goes further.
Now, what else may do this turtle ?
Let's try to turn it ; hit "turn left" 
> turn left
OK, it turned, lets move it again now ; hit "forward 5"
> forward 5
Ok, now may be it can turn back it right ? try to guess how to do it
> turn right
Well done ! You guessed it !
